Hi there (｡･∀･)ﾉﾞ. 

I am a Ph.D. student at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Tieniu Tan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W-FGd_UAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and co-supervision of [Prof. Jian Liang](https://liangjian.xyz/), [Prof. Ran He](https://rhe-web.github.io/) and [Prof. Zilei Wang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~zlwang/index_en.html). Before that, I earned my BS in Electronic Information Engineering from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2021.

My current research focuses on developing safe, robust, and efficient fine-tuning methods for vision-language models and large language models. See also my <a href="{{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}"> list of publications. </a>

You can download my CV here.
